  title: "Testing with MockStore in NgRx 9"
  extract: > 
    What's new in NgRx testing? Actually, a lot! The two most recent releases of NgRx have quietly introduced and iterated
    the @ngrx/store/testing module, giving developers easier ways to test store-dependent components and services. 
    In this session, I will demonstrate testing store-dependent components and services using the NgRx MockStore, 
    which provides the ability to mock the entire state or individual selectors. Say goodbye to the StoreModule!

  title: "Accessibility, what, why and how?"
  extract: > 
    Providing access to everyone is also part of our job, we create content and put it out there so it makes sense that everyone can use it right? 
    Sadly this is not the case, the web is filled with unaccessible sites and we need to do something about it. 
    Accessibility should not be disregarded or forgotten, it should be taken in account on every step of the way!

  title: "Sending the Angular app into deep, deep offline with Workbox	"
  extract: > 
    There is no need to advocate for progressive web apps anymore.
    The idea of connection-independent applications has proven its viability and we see more and more large and small projects following that path, making the offline-ready behavior a best practice, good manner of the web. In my session, based on the deep exploration of Service Worker API possibilities and gathered UX gotchas, we go through the history of the offline web, the importance of treating the network as an enhancement, current challenges (and their solutions) and proper tooling. We architect our offline-ready Angular app applying the best tech and UX practices adding the features one-by-one: app shell, caching resources and data, sync when online. 
    All in name of our users who demand the new level of the resilient web experience.
