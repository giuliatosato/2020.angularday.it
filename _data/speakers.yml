      Ana is a Developer Advocate at Auth0. She has a degree in Fine Arts and a Master in International Business
        Economics and Management, so she is not your usual software developer. She loves to code and she especially
        likes Angular. As a very active member of the community, she regularly organises meetups and conferences,
        like the amazing ngSpain. In Spain, where she’s currently based, she’s an organiser of GDG Vigo and the founder
        of GalsTech, a group for women in tech from Galicia. Because she is so passionate about diversity, she has also
        been named a Women Techmaker Ambassador.
